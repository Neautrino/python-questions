In this code, the linear_search function takes an array (arr) and a target element (target) as input and iterates through the array one element at a time. If it finds the target element, it returns the index where it was found. If the target element is not found after checking all elements, it returns -1 to indicate that the element is not present in the array.

The example usage shows how to call the linear_search function with a sample list and target element and prints the result.
