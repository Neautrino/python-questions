# Tic-Tac-Toe AI in Python

This is a Python program that allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent. The AI is designed to make intelligent moves to provide a challenging gameplay experience.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script in your terminal or command prompt.

2. The Tic-Tac-Toe board will be displayed, and you will be "X" while the AI is "O."

3. Enter your moves by typing a number from 0 to 8 to choose an available spot on the board.

4. The AI will make strategic moves to win the game or block you from winning.

5. Continue playing until one player wins, or the game ends in a draw.

## AI Strategy

The AI follows a basic strategy:

- It attempts to win the game on the next move.
- It tries to block the opponent from winning.
- It selects the center of the board if available.
- It picks a random corner if possible.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it chooses a random available spot.

## Enjoy the Game!

Have fun playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI and testing your strategic skills. Feel free to modify and expand the AI's decision-making algorithm to make it even more challenging.
