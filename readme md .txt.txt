# Optimal Card Stacking

## Description

Optimal Card Stacking is a Python solution to the problem of maximizing the sum of card values in a specific stacking scenario. Given a list of card values, the program determines the optimal way to stack the cards following specific rules, ensuring the maximum sum is achieved.

## Problem Statement

The problem involves finding the optimal arrangement of cards to maximize their total value. Each card has a value, and cards can only be stacked on cards with smaller values. The challenge is to find the arrangement that yields the highest possible sum.

## Solution Overview

The solution utilizes dynamic programming. It calculates the maximum sum of card values that can be obtained by considering different subarrays of the given card values. The algorithm efficiently finds the arrangement that achieves the highest sum based on the specified stacking rules.
