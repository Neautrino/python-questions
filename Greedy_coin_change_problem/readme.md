# Greedy Coin Change Algorithm (Python)
# Introduction
The greedy_coin_change function is a Python implementation of the greedy algorithm for solving the coin change problem. The problem involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount using a specific set of coin denominations. This README provides an overview of the function, its usage, and details about how it works.

# How the Algorithm Works
The greedy coin change algorithm follows these steps:

Sort the list of coin denominations in descending order.
Initialize an empty list to store the coins used to make change.
Iterate through the sorted list of coin denominations, starting with the largest denomination.
For each coin denomination, enter a while loop as long as the remaining amount is greater than or equal to the current coin's value.
Inside the loop, append the current coin to the result list and subtract its value from the remaining amount.
After iterating through all available coin denominations or until the amount becomes zero, check if the amount is equal to zero.
If the amount is zero, return the result list, which contains the optimal combination of coins to make change. If the amount is not zero, return an empty list, indicating that it's not possible to make exact change with the available coin denominations.
# Usage
Define a list of coin denominations and the amount to make change for:
coins = [50,25, 10, 5, 1]  # Coin denominations in cents
amount = 77  # Amount to make change for in cents
Call the greedy_coin_change function with the coin denominations and the amount as arguments:


change = greedy_coin_change(coins, amount)
The function will return a list representing the minimum number of coins needed to make change. If it's not possible to make exact change, it will return an empty list.

Print or use the change list for further processing:
print(change)  
# Output:
[50, 25, 1, 1]
# Example Usage
Here's an example of using the greedy_coin_change function to make change for 77 cents using common coin denominations:
coins = [50,25, 10, 5, 1]   # Coin denominations in cents
amount = 63  # Amount to make change for in cents
change = greedy_coin_change(coins, amount)
print(change)  # Output: [25, 25, 10, 1, 1, 1]
