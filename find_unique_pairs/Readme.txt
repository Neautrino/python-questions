Question:
You are given a list of integers. Write a Python function, find_unique_pairs(lst, target), that takes this list and a target integer as input. The function should find and return a list of unique pairs of integers from the input list that add up to the target integer. Each pair should only be included once, and the order of the integers in each pair doesn't matter.
In this Python function, find_unique_pairs, we use a set (unique_pairs) to store unique pairs that sum up to the target value. We also use a set (seen_numbers) to keep track of numbers we've seen in the input list. We iterate through the list, calculate the complement for each number (the number needed to reach the target), and check if the complement has been seen before. If it has, we add the pair of numbers to the unique_pairs set. Finally, we convert the set to a list and return it.
