Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
This program defines a function are_anagrams that takes two words as input,
removes spaces and converts them to lowercase, 
and then checks if the sorted letters of both words are the same.
If they are, it prints that the words are anagrams; otherwise, it prints that they are not.
